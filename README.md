# The structure and function analusis of ACE2- the receptor of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV2) 

ABSTRACT

Objective: angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a member of the RAS (renin-angiotensin system), was found to be a receptor for SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV2).
The study of the structure, function, and spike glycoprotein binding site of ACE2 is particularly important for the development of vaccines and the design of treatment plans. 
Method: Protparam, Blast, mEMBOSS, MEGA X, ClustalW, and other bioinformatics methods and tools were performed to predict the sequence characteristics, molecular structure, physical and chemical properties of ACE2 genes and their encoded proteins. 
The results showed that the ACE2 gene locates on X chromosomes (Xp22.2: 15494520-15602069), and the CDS is 3325bp. Its protein contained 805 amino acid residues. 
The secondary structure was calculated on the mEMBOSS Garnier program. The residue totals of helix, sheet, turn, and coil are 338, 172,144,and 151, respectively, and residue percents are 42.8%, 21.8%,18.3%,19.1%. 
The tertiary structure of the ACE2 protein was calculated by SWISS-MODEL systems. ACE2 protein regions (positions 30-41, 82-84, 353-357), which interacted with SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein. 
Molecular phylogenetic trees of 22 proteins (manually reviewed UniProtKB / Swiss-Prot from different species) were constructed using the MEGA X tool. Sequence Alignments of ACE2 (Accession: Q9BY1), SARS CoV2 (2019-nCoV) receptor-binding domain as well as Crystal structure of SARS CoV2 (2019-nCoV) spike receptor-binding domain which bound with ACE2 were found. 
Molecular docking analysis of ACE2 and spike glycoprotein were analyzed by PATCHDOCK and ClusPro. VMD and APBS were used to create surface shape and surface charge distribution of ACE2 protein. 
These studies can provide theoretical references for further research on the properties and mechanisms of human ACE2 protein.
